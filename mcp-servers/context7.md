Context7
Editor's Note
Context7 provides an MCP server that delivers up-to-date, version-specific documentation and code examples directly into LLM prompts by fetching current information from source repositories. The server solves the problem of LLMs generating outdated code examples, hallucinated APIs, and generic answers based on old training data by injecting real-time documentation context for libraries and frameworks. It enables developers to request code examples and API information for specific tools (like Next.js, Cloudflare Workers, and Supabase) with the assurance of receiving current, accurate guidance.

Install
claude mcp add --transport stdio upstash-context7 uvx context7

❌ Without Context7
LLMs rely on outdated or generic information about the libraries you use. You get:

❌ Code examples are outdated and based on year-old training data
❌ Hallucinated APIs that don't even exist
❌ Generic answers for old package versions
✅ With Context7
Context7 pulls up-to-date, version-specific documentation and code examples straight from the source — and places them directly into your prompt.

Create a Next.js middleware that checks for a valid JWT in cookies
and redirects unauthenticated users to `/login`. use context7
Configure a Cloudflare Worker script to cache
JSON API responses for five minutes. use context7
Show me the Supabase auth API for email/password sign-up.
Context7 fetches up-to-date code examples and documentation right into your LLM's context. No tab-switching, no hallucinated APIs that don't exist, no outdated code generation.

Works in two modes:

CLI + Skills — installs a skill that guides your agent to fetch docs using ctx7 CLI commands (no MCP required)
MCP — registers a Context7 MCP server so your agent can call documentation tools natively
Installation
[!NOTE] API Key Recommended: Get a free API key at context7.com/dashboard for higher rate limits.

Set up Context7 for your coding agents with a single command:

npx ctx7 setup
Authenticates via OAuth, generates an API key, and installs the appropriate skill. You can choose between CLI + Skills or MCP mode. Use --cursor, --claude, or --opencode to target a specific agent.

To remove the generated setup later, run npx ctx7 remove. If you globally installed the CLI with npm install -g ctx7, remove that package separately with npm uninstall -g ctx7.

To configure manually, use the Context7 server URL https://mcp.context7.com/mcp with your MCP client and pass your API key via the CONTEXT7_API_KEY header. See the link below for client-specific setup instructions.

Important Tips
Use Library Id
If you already know exactly which library you want to use, add its Context7 ID to your prompt. That way, Context7 can skip the library-matching step and directly retrieve docs.

Implement basic authentication with Supabase. use library /supabase/supabase for API and docs.
The slash syntax tells Context7 exactly which library to load docs for.

Specify a Version
To get documentation for a specific library version, just mention the version in your prompt:

How do I set up Next.js 14 middleware? use context7
Context7 will automatically match the appropriate version.

Add a Rule
If you installed via ctx7 setup, a skill is configured automatically that triggers Context7 for library-related questions. To set up a rule manually instead, add one to your coding agent:

Cursor: Cursor Settings > Rules
Claude Code: CLAUDE.md
Or the equivalent in your coding agent
Example rule:

Always use Context7 when I need library/API documentation, code generation, setup or configuration steps without me having to explicitly ask.
Available Tools
CLI Commands
ctx7 library <name> <query>: Searches the Context7 index by library name and returns matching libraries with their IDs.
ctx7 docs <libraryId> <query>: Retrieves documentation for a library using a Context7-compatible library ID (e.g., /mongodb/docs, /vercel/next.js).
MCP Tools
resolve-library-id: Resolves a general library name into a Context7-compatible library ID.
query (required): The user's question or task (used to rank results by relevance)
libraryName (required): The name of the library to search for
query-docs: Retrieves documentation for a library using a Context7-compatible library ID.
libraryId (required): Exact Context7-compatible library ID (e.g., /mongodb/docs, /vercel/next.js)
query (required): The question or task to get relevant documentation for
