Git
Editor's Note
The Git MCP server provides tools to read, search, and manipulate Git repositories, enabling LLMs to interact with version control systems through the Model Context Protocol. It offers capabilities for repository operations while maintaining security through controlled access patterns. This reference implementation demonstrates how MCP can grant AI models safe, structured access to Git functionality and repository data.

Model Context Protocol servers
This repository is a collection of reference implementations for the Model Context Protocol (MCP), as well as references to community-built servers and additional resources.

[!IMPORTANT] If you are looking for a list of MCP servers, you can browse published servers on the MCP Registry. The repository served by this README is dedicated to housing just the small number of reference servers maintained by the MCP steering group.

[!WARNING] The servers in this repository are intended as reference implementations to demonstrate MCP features and SDK usage. They are meant to serve as educational examples for developers building their own MCP servers, not as production-ready solutions. Developers should evaluate their own security requirements and implement appropriate safeguards based on their specific threat model and use case.

The servers in this repository showcase the versatility and extensibility of MCP, demonstrating how it can be used to give Large Language Models (LLMs) secure, controlled access to tools and data sources. Typically, each MCP server is implemented with an MCP SDK:

C# MCP SDK
Go MCP SDK
Java MCP SDK
Kotlin MCP SDK
PHP MCP SDK
Python MCP SDK
Ruby MCP SDK
Rust MCP SDK
Swift MCP SDK
TypeScript MCP SDK

🚀 Getting Started
Using MCP Servers in this Repository
TypeScript-based servers in this repository can be used directly with npx.

For example, this will start the Memory server:

npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-memory
Python-based servers in this repository can be used directly with uvx or pip. uvx is recommended for ease of use and setup.

For example, this will start the Git server:

# With uvx
uvx mcp-server-git

# With pip
pip install mcp-server-git
python -m mcp_server_git
Follow these instructions to install uv / uvx and these to install pip.

Using an MCP Client
However, running a server on its own isn't very useful, and should instead be configured into an MCP client. For example, here's the Claude Desktop configuration to use the above server:

{
  "mcpServers": {
    "memory": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-memory"]
    }
  }
}
On Windows, wrap npx with cmd /c:

{
  "mcpServers": {
    "memory": {
      "command": "cmd",
      "args": ["/c", "npx", "-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-memory"]
    }
  }
}
Additional examples of using the Claude Desktop as an MCP client might look like:

{
  "mcpServers": {
    "filesystem": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "/path/to/allowed/files"]
    },
    "git": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["mcp-server-git", "--repository", "path/to/git/repo"]
    },
    "github": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-github"],
      "env": {
        "GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN": "<YOUR_TOKEN>"
      }
    },
    "postgres": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-postgres", "postgresql://localhost/mydb"]
    }
  }
}
On Windows, apply the same wrapper to each npx-based entry above by changing "command" to "cmd" and prepending "/c", "npx" to the existing args. Leave uvx entries unchanged.
